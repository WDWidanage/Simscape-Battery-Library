function plotVariables(simout,block_names,nvp)
% Plot the distributed varaibles of TECMD, TSPMe and TSPMeA model types,
% found in the sismcape BatteryLibrary, once a simulation run is complete.
%
% Mandtory inputs
%   simout: This is the output that Simulink generates in the workspage
%           when you run a Simulink model or when you call the "sim"
%           command to simulate a Simulink model.
%   block_names: Specify the names of the BatteryLibrary components that
%               were used in the simulink model as a vector of strings.
%
% Optional inouts (name-value pairs)
%   "plot": "all" (default),
%   "state_name": This is the name of the states that in the simout
%                 simulink object "xout" (default)
